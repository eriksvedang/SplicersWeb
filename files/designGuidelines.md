# Guidelines

### Card Types
There are 5 card types: Tings, Mutations, Events, Bioms and Splicers. A Splicers deck consists of at least 18 cards including 1 Splicer card and 2 Bioms. Read up on card types in the [official rules document.](/rules)

### Title
Note that you cannot make cards with the same title as another already existing card.

---

### Subtype
A card usually has one "subtype" that works mostly as flavour but can be targeted by other card. For example, the **hunt** keyword only works on cards with the "animal" type. It's totally fine to just leave the subtype blank.

Below are the most commonly used, however you can come up with whatever subtypes you want.
