Here are some tips and tricks for making your own cards.

---

### Card Types
There are 5 card types: Tings, Mutations, Events, Bioms and Splicers. A Splicers deck consists of at least 18 cards including 1 Splicer card and 2 Bioms. If you want to know more about card types you can read the [official rules document.](/rules)

### Title
Note that you cannot make cards with the same title as another already existing card unless you're the one who created the original card. If you make a new card with the same title as one of your own cards you will replace the old card with your new one!

If you want to make a new version of someone else's card, make a slightly different title. For example, if you want to create a more powerful version of the card named 'Crown', perhaps name if 'Glorious Crown', 'Crown 2.0' or 'Very Shiny Crown'.

---

### Subtype
A card usually has one subtype that can be used by other card's rule text. For example, the ability **hunt** only works on Tings with the subtype 'Animal' while **graze** can only be used on 'Plant':s.

For events and splicers it's totally fine to just leave the subtype blank!

Below are the most commonly used subtypes, however you can come up with whatever new ones you want.

Tings:
- Animal
- Plant
- Artificial
- Fungi

Bioms:
- Terran
- Aquatic
- Elevated

### Dominance

To make a card balanced and fun it's important to get its dominance value right. You're free to set any dominance you'd like but here's an easy way of calculating it based on the other stats of the card:

1. If it's an animal, start with a dominance of 3 - otherwise start with 2.
1. If it can hunt, subtract 1.
1. If it can graze, subtract ½.
1. If it has a requirement, add 1.
1. If it's expensive, add 1.
1. If it has other costs, add 1 per extra cost.
1. All other rules should add/remove about ½ - 1 point depending on how good or bad they are for the Ting.
1. Round to the closest whole number.

Voila - now you have a pretty good dominance value! Playtest the card and see if you need to adjust something. Making a great card often takes several iterations.

### Genes

You can use any combination of genes for a card. Genes are used when splicing, as requirements from bioms, and as targets by rule text on other cards. A card can also use other genes that you come up with, or it can be missing one or both genes.

### Rules

Try to read through a few other cards before writing the rules on your card. By making your rules follow the same pattern and way of expression they will be a lot easier for other players to understand!

---

### Flavor

If you want to you can add flavor text at the bottom of the card. It shouldn't contain rules and is just to enhance the feel of the card.

---

### Illustration

You can paste a URL to an image here and it will show up on the card. Note that the image has to be hosted online at some other site.

Please don't use images that are too big since it will slow the page down!

---

### Start Cards

This stat is only applicable on Splicers. It's the number of cards that the player of the deck should start with. The standard number of start cards is 4. Adjust it up or down depending on how strong the Splicer's personal power is.
