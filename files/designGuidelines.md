# Guidelines
Each player does the following:
1. Prepare your deck by shuffling your cards (except your splicer and biom cards) and place them face down in front of you. Make room for a "discard pile" to place discarded cards.
2. Place the splicer card face up next to the deck and the biom cards face up in a row between the players.
3. Draw a number of cards (indicated on your splicer card) to form a hand of cards.
4. Randomly determine first player.

Now, in turn order starting with the first player, each player may perform a mulligan. The game then starts with the first round, skipping the start of round phase (see turn structure below).
